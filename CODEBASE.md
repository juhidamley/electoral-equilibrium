# Codebase Reference — Electoral Equilibrium

Every source file documented, organized by directory. For each file: what it does,
what it reads/writes, and what stage of the pipeline it belongs to.

**Total source files:** ~130 Python modules + configs + tests + frontend  
**Test status:** 349 passing, 21 skipped (skipped = Week 2+ kernels not yet implemented)  
**Implemented:** Week 1 (data pipeline). Weeks 2–7 are stubs that raise `NotImplementedError`.

## Top-Level Files

| File | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| `CLAUDE.md` | Instructions for Claude Code: project overview, compute stack, repo structure, artifact schemas, optimizer formula, Monte Carlo algorithm, key invariants. Not part of the application — it is agent context. |
| `README.md` | User-facing project documentation: what the system does, pipeline overview, setup instructions, compute stack map. |
| `DECISIONS.md` | Log of every architectural decision with rationale. Consult before modifying any module. Every design choice that isn't obvious from the code is explained here. |
| `ESPINOSA.md` | Open questions for supervisor check-ins. Grouped by topic and urgency. |
| `DOMAIN.md` | Generalization contract for porting the framework to non-electoral domains. Defines the interface a new domain must implement. |
| `AGENTS.md` | Contributor conventions: branch naming, code style, PR requirements, validation discipline, artifact-first design. Read this before contributing. |
| `QWEN.md` | Qwen2.5-7B documentation for the local cleaning model on the M5 MacBook. Records recommended inference parameters and revision hash once selected. |
| `Justfile` | Task runner (similar to Makefile). Key targets: `just smoke` (run full pipeline with smoke config), `just test` (pytest), `just clean` (rm artifacts), `just score` / `just train` (HPC SLURM submission). |
| `pyproject.toml` | Python project metadata and dependency declarations. Core: `numpy`, `pandas`, `pyarrow`. Optional groups: `data` (survey processing), `ml` (sklearn, cvxpy), `llm` (transformers, peft), `dev` (pytest, ruff, black, mypy). |
| `main.py` | Entry point alias — calls `electoral.pipeline.main()`. |
| `.env` | Local environment variables (not committed). Stores Tailscale IP, API keys. |

## `electoral/` — Core Package

### Package Root

#### `electoral/__init__.py`
Empty package marker.

#### `electoral/config.py`
**Purpose:** Immutable pipeline configuration loaded from JSON.

`PipelineConfig` is a frozen dataclass. Key fields:
- `run_key` — unique string identifying this run (e.g. `"base_2026"`)
- `seed` — global RNG seed; all stochastic operations derive from this
- `party` — `"democrat"` or `"republican"`
- `target` — V_eq win threshold (~0.535 for Democrats)
- `pipeline_mode` — `"historical"` (full rebuild) or `"continuous"` (nightly incremental)
- `races/religions/genders` — canonical bloc lists; defaults to the 5/7/3 canonical sets
- `pi_bio_server` — Tailscale URL for Raspberry Pi SetFit endpoint
- `pi_npu_enabled` — whether Hailo NPU is available

`from_json(path)` loads from JSON and silently ignores unknown keys, allowing forward compatibility. `derive_seed(stage_name)` delegates to `electoral.core.rng.derive_seed`.

#### `electoral/artifacts.py`
**Purpose:** All frozen dataclass schemas for every pipeline stage. This is the single source of truth for what each stage produces and consumes.

Every dataclass has `to_dict()` / `from_dict()` / `validate()`. No pandas or numpy in payload fields — all native Python types.

| Class | Stage | Key fields |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| `StageArtifact` | Envelope | `stage`, `run_key`, `metadata`, `data` |
| `VoterPanelData` | Stage 1 | `cycles`, `races`, `religions`, `genders`, `layer_weights`, `source` |
| `BaselinePortfolioData` | Stage 2 | `weights` (race→float), `mu_race/religion/gender`, `mu_eff`, `target` |
| `SentimentData` | Stage 3a | `model`, `shocks`, `scores[bloc][shock]=elasticity` |
| `SocialMediaSentimentData` | Stage 3b | `shock`, `platforms`, `scores[platform][proxy]`, `lagged_delta` |
| `LLMFineTuneData` | Stage 3c | `base_model`, `lora_rank`, `n_examples`, `cycles_used`, `adapter_path` |
| `PredictionMarketData` | Stage 3d | `pre_shock_prob`, `post_shock_*`, `delta_prob`, `sources` |
| `ShockResponseData` | Stage 4 | `shock`, `deltas[bloc]=Δμ`, `covariance` (N×N), `source` |
| `EquilibriumData` | Stage 5 | `weights[bloc]`, `mu_shifted[bloc]`, `feasible`, `target_met` |
| `SimulationData` | Stage 6 | `n_simulations`, `win_probability`, `percentiles[bloc]=[p5,p25,p50,p75,p95]` |
| `MetricsTablesData` | Stage 7 | `tables[key]=JSON payload` |

`ShockResponseData.deltas` values are clamped to `[-0.15, +0.15]` (validated). `EquilibriumData.weights` must sum to 1.0 and be keyed by race blocs only (religion/gender weights are fixed, not optimized).

#### `electoral/stages.py`
**Purpose:** One function per pipeline stage. Currently only Stage 1 (`build_voter_panel`) is fully implemented; the rest return valid placeholder artifacts. Each function:
1. Calls the corresponding kernel
2. Writes the panel parquet files (Stage 1) or artifact JSON
3. Returns the typed payload dataclass

Stage dependency graph:
```
build_voter_panel ──► build_baseline_portfolio
                 └──► build_sentiment_data ──► build_llm_finetune
                                          └──► build_shock_response
                                                    └──► build_optimization
                                                               └──► run_simulations
```

#### `electoral/pipeline.py`
**Purpose:** Prefect DAG orchestrating all stage functions.

Uses `@flow` and `@task` decorators. Falls back to plain Python execution if Prefect is not installed (so CI works without the full Prefect stack). Tasks share a retry policy of 2 retries with 30-second delay. `task_baseline_portfolio` and `task_sentiment_data` both take the same `panel` future — Prefect executes them concurrently.

CLI: `python -m electoral.pipeline --config configs/base.json --shock "tariff" --intensity 0.7`

---

### `electoral/core/` — Infrastructure

#### `electoral/core/types.py`
**Purpose:** All type aliases and canonical constants. Single source of truth for demographic bloc identifiers.

Key exports:
- `Race`, `Religion`, `Gender` — `str`-mixin enums (members are valid strings and work as dict keys)
- `CANONICAL_RACES` — `["african_american","latino","asian","white","other_race"]`
- `CANONICAL_RELIGIONS` — `["evangelical","catholic","protestant","secular","jewish","muslim","other_rel"]`
- `CANONICAL_GENDERS` — `["women","men","other_gender"]`
- `DELTA_BINS` — 9-token vocabulary for LLM constrained decoding
- `BIN_MIDPOINTS` — numeric midpoint for each bin (used by `bin_to_delta()`)
- `LAYER_WEIGHT_KEYS` — `("lambda_1","lambda_2","lambda_3")`
- `VALID_SOURCES` — `{"llm_unified","roberta_news_only","roberta_social_only"}`

Use `Race.WHITE` not the string literal `"white"` in kernel code.

#### `electoral/core/schema.py`
**Purpose:** Five validation helpers used by `validate()` methods in `artifacts.py`.

| Function | What it checks |
|----------|---------------|
| `assert_required_keys(d, keys, context)` | All keys present in dict |
| `assert_shares_sum_to_one(d, context)` | Dict float values sum to 1.0 ± 1e-6 |
| `assert_valid_share(v, name, context)` | Float in [0, 1] |
| `assert_sorted_unique(lst, name, context)` | List is sorted and deduplicated |
| `assert_unique(lst, name, context)` | List has no duplicates |

#### `electoral/core/rng.py`
**Purpose:** Deterministic RNG contract. Ensures reproducibility across runs.

- `derive_seed_tokens(tokens: list[str]) → int` — SHA-256 hash of `":"` -joined tokens, modded to `[0, 2**31)`
- `derive_seed(base_seed, stage_name) → int` — convenience wrapper: `derive_seed_tokens([str(base_seed), stage_name])`
- `make_rng(seed) → np.random.Generator` — PCG64 generator

**Contract:** Never call `np.random` directly. Never call `random.seed()` globally. Every stochastic operation must receive a `make_rng(derive_seed(config.seed, stage_name))` generator.

#### `electoral/core/io.py`
**Purpose:** Artifact I/O: write/read JSON envelopes and Parquet tables.

- `write_artifact(path, d)` — writes JSON; creates parent directories automatically
- `write_parquet(path, df)` — writes DataFrame to Parquet (no index)
- `read_artifact(path) → dict` — reads JSON; unwraps `StageArtifact` envelope if present
- `read_parquet(path) → pd.DataFrame`

---

### `electoral/data/` — Survey Data Processing

#### `electoral/data/loaders.py`
**Purpose:** Source-specific loaders for each survey dataset. Each loader reads a raw or labeled file and returns an uncleaned DataFrame with canonical column names applied.

| Function | Survey | File |
|----------|--------|------|
| `load_arda(path)` | ANES CDF (mislabeled "ARDA" in devplan) | `anes_labeled_subset.parquet` |
| `load_gss(path)` | General Social Survey | `gss_labeled_subset.parquet` |
| `load_gallup(path)` | Democracy Fund VOTER Panel (mislabeled "Gallup") | `voter_panel.csv` |
| `load_nep(path)` | CNN/SSRS National Exit Polls | `nep_{year}_exit_poll.csv` |
| `load_pew(path)` | NPORS (mislabeled "Pew") | `npors_2024_labeled.parquet` |
| `load_ces(path)` | CES cumulative 2006–2024 | `ces_cumulative_labeled.parquet` |
| `load_ces_2024(path)` | CES 2024 single-year | `ces_2024_labeled.parquet` |
| `load_csv_panel(path)` | Generic preprocessed panel CSV | any panel CSV |

Column remapping uses `configs/column_maps.json` (raw source column names → canonical names). Each loader applies the map via `_apply_map()`, which skips unmappable columns and prevents many-to-one collisions.

**Important naming corrections** (devplan used wrong names):
- "ARDA" in devplan = ANES CDF
- "Gallup" in devplan = Democracy Fund VOTER Panel
- "Pew" in devplan = NPORS (Pew's National Public Opinion Reference Survey)

#### `electoral/data/cleaning.py`
**Purpose:** Cleans a raw survey panel DataFrame. Applied after loading, before aggregation.

`clean_raw_panel(df)` runs six steps in order:
1. Coerce `cycle` to nullable Int64 (YYYY)
2. Normalise `bloc` to lowercase snake_case via `_normalize_bloc()`
3. Map normalised bloc strings to canonical IDs via `normalize_bloc()`
4. Coerce `vote_share` and `turnout` to nullable Float64
5. Drop rows where `cycle` or `bloc` is null; log count
6. Sort by `(cycle, bloc)`; raise on duplicate `(cycle, bloc, source)` tuples

`normalize_bloc(raw: str) → str` is the public function for scalar normalisation. It handles ~80 survey alias strings (e.g. `"Black/African American"` → `"african_american"`, `"White Evangelical"` → `"evangelical"`).

`_BLOC_MAP` contains the complete alias table — update this when adding new source aliases.

#### `electoral/data/panel.py`
**Purpose:** Validates a panel DataFrame against five structural invariants.

`validate_panel(df, required_cols, context)` enforces:
1. All required columns present
2. No nulls in required columns
3. `cycle` is int YYYY in [1900, 2100]
4. `bloc` IDs are lowercase snake_case (regex: `^[a-z][a-z0-9]*(_[a-z0-9]+)*$`)
5. `vote_share` and `turnout` (when present) are in [0, 1]

---

### `electoral/kernels/` — Stage Implementations

#### `electoral/kernels/data.py` ✅ IMPLEMENTED (Week 1)
**Purpose:** Voter panel kernel — loads all survey sources, resolves conflicts, and returns `VoterPanelData`.

`build_voter_panel(config) → (VoterPanelData, pd.DataFrame)` orchestrates:
1. `_from_nep(paths)` — loads all 4 NEP exit-poll CSVs; computes binomial SE from `n_total × stratum_share`
2. `_from_anes(path)` — ANES labeled subset; maps vote_indicator encoding (1=Dem, 2=Rep, 3=Other); Kish effective-sample-size SE
3. `_from_gss(path)` — GSS retrospective vote columns (`pres16`/`pres20`); handles per-wave election mapping
4. `_from_ces(path)` — CES cumulative; presidential cycles only (year % 4 == 0); `weight_cumulative` weighting
5. `resolve_conflicts(panel)` — inverse-SE weighted merge for (cycle, bloc) pairs in multiple sources; merged `source` = sorted "+" join

Source-specific bloc remaps (`_ANES_RACE`, `_GSS_RELIGION`, `_CES_GENDER`, etc.) are hardcoded dicts at the top of the file.

`_agg_stratum()` is the shared aggregation helper: maps raw bloc labels → canonical IDs, drops unmapped/null rows, computes weighted vote_share and Kish SE per (cycle, bloc).

`resolve_conflicts()` logs every conflict at INFO level. Missing (cycle, bloc) cells are logged as warnings.
